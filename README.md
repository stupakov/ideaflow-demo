## experimenting with draft.js

This is a basic React.js app which implements a draft.js text editor that includes autocomplete.
The draft.js [mentions plugin](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/tree/master/draft-js-mention-plugin) is used to implement autocomplete.

Autocomplete triggers:

- `@` - people
- `#` - hashtags
- `<>` - relations

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
